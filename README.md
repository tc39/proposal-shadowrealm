## <a name='WhatareRealms'></a>What are ShadowRealms?

ShadowRealms are a distinct global environment, with its own global object containing its own intrinsics and built-ins (standard objects that are not bound to global variables, like the initial value of Object.prototype).

See more at the [explainer](explainer.md) document.

## <a name='APITypeScriptFormat'></a>API (TypeScript Format)

```ts
declare class ShadowRealm {
    constructor();
    importValue(specifier: string, bindingName: string): Promise<PrimitiveValueOrCallable>;
    evaluate(sourceText: string): PrimitiveValueOrCallable;
}
```

See some examples [in the Explainer file](explainer.md).

## <a name='History'></a>History

* we moved on from the exposed globalThis model to a lean isolated realms API (see #289 and #291)
* we worked on this during ES2015 time frame, so never went through stages process ([ES6 Realm Objects proto-spec.pdf](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-shadowrealm/files/717415/ES6.Realm.Objects.proto-spec.pdf))
* got punted to later (rightly so!)
* goal of this proposal: resume work on this, reassert committee interest via advancing to stage 2
* original idea from @dherman: [What are Realms?](https://gist.github.com/dherman/7568885)

The source for the spec text is located in [spec.html](spec.html) and it is written in
[ecmarkup](https://github.com/bterlson/ecmarkup) language.

When modifying the spec text, you should be able to build the HTML version by using the following command:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
open dist/index.html
```

Alternatively, you can use `npm run watch`.
