unscopables: with(foo) should not say that 'foo' has, e.g. hasOwnProperty

 with(foo):
   hasOwnProperty('bar') // should not use foo.hasOwnProperty

document[Symbol.unscopables] === ['append', 'prepend']

undeniables:
 * Promise.prototype (via async function return value)
 * Object.prototype
 * Function.prototype
 * AsyncFunction.prototype
 * GeneratorFunction.prototype
 * AsyncGeneratorFunction.prototype
 * Array.prototype: Object.getPrototypeOf([])
 * RegExp.prototype: Object.getPrototypeOf(//)
 * Boolean ? : getPrototypeOf(Object(false))
 * Number ?
 * String ?

buildOptimizer:
* scan safeGlobal, find own properties which have valid variable names
  (regexp) and whose descriptors say they're unwritable and unconfigurable
  * "how hard could it be?" A: unicode.
  * this is merely an optimization, so limiting ourselves to valid ASCII
    variable names is ok.
  * this also removes the potential injection attack from getting an array
    with commas in the members


test('function-unbalanced-comments', t => {
  const r = Realm.makeRootRealm();

  const f1 = new r.global.Function('a', '/*', evilFunc);

  // we never actually invoke the function, we only parse it
  t.end();

we need a full whitelist of paths that are allowed to be present on the
global object: we should scan and delete everything that's not on the list.
See caja src/com/google/caja/ses/whitelist.js . eg RegExp.$1

markm keeps forgetting: the alternate function constructors do not need safe
versions, even though we could make safe versions, because there is no place
to put them. Because they're evaluators they have to be per-compartment, but
they don't have global names, so there's no place to put them such that
they're reachable from the compartment.

todo: we have two enumerations of the alternate function constructors (one in
functions.js and the other in instrinsics.js), document that they must be
kept in sync

handler: shadow a frozen eval inherited from the real target. proxy
invariants only check the first level. make the proxy's target be an empty
mutable object that inherits from the safe global. so the proxy can act as if
it has the 'eval' property: the target doesn't commit to stability, so the
proxy doesn't either. we need a set trap, which sets the value on the global
rather than on the target. proxy is allowed to switch the value because the
target doesn't commit to stability. user code gets access to safe global, but
not to the proxy or the target. This also means we can change stdlib's
.eval/.Function in the frozen-realm case to be non-writable non-configurable.
todo: add tests that the user can freeze their global object.


todo: rename the base Realm class to 'BaseRealm', don't expose it as the
'Realm' in the primal realm, invoke the realm facade string (buildChildRealm)
with the primal realm's 'eval()' to build the 'Realm' that we expose in the
primal realm. Might let us avoid the weakmaps?

make the Realm *constructor* be the weakmap key, not the prototype?
